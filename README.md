About
===================
NotifyMyAndroid.NET is a portable class library, currently targetting the .NET Framework 4.5 and .NET for Windows Store apps.
It is essentially a thin wrapper around the new HTTP APIs in the System.Net.Http namespace. I'd recommend you'd check it out if you haven't already.
